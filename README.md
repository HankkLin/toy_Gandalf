# Toy_Gandalf Chatbot Repository

Toy_Gandalf is a fun and interactive chatbot implemented using the OpenAI API. The chatbot challenges users to guess a password that it's hiding, with four different difficulty levels: "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", and "Hell". Players can have an enjoyable time trying to crack the password while interacting with the chatbot.

## Getting Started

To play with Toy_Gandalf, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Toy_Gandalf.git

```
2. Edit the config file (config.py) and replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key. You can obtain the API key by signing up for an account with OpenAI.

```py
openAI_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

3. Run the app.py file to start the chatbot.

```bash
python app.py
```
## How to Play
Once the chatbot is running, it will present you with different difficulty levels to choose from: "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", and "Hell". Each difficulty level has its own unique prompt and password to guess.

Simply type your guesses into the chatbot's interface, and it will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or not. Keep guessing until you find the correct password or give up!

## Difficulty Levels
- Easy: A simple and straightforward level to get you warmed up.

- Medium: A bit trickier than Easy, but still manageable for most players.

- Hard: Things get challenging here. You'll need to think carefully and use some strategy.

- Hell: Only the bravest should attempt this level. The password will be extremely hard to guess.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to extend our gratitude to OpenAI for providing the powerful API that makes Toy_Gandalf possible.

Toy_Gandalf is a toy version inspired by the original "Gandalf" chatbot created by Lakera. I acknowledge the creative work done by Lakera, which served as the foundation for this fun and interactive project.

Happy guessing! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
